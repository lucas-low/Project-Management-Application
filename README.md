Despite previous commits history during the building of this app, I will be making changes here on out to adhere to CI/CD defined as;
- Lint: to keep code clean and maintainable
- Build: put all code together into software
- Test: ensure existing features dont break
- Package: put together in easily movable batch
- Upload/Deploy: Making it publicly available to the world (currently on heroku) with deployment pipeline from each code commit automatically to Heroku after passing the prior steps
- Documentation
